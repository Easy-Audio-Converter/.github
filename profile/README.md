## üöÄ Overview

Easy Audio Converter is a powerful macOS app built for anyone who needs flexibility, speed, and control in converting and extracting audio. Whether you're converting your favorite music to a portable format, ripping audio from forgotten videos, or preparing tracks for editing or streaming, this tool handles all those tasks with ease.

You can drag in audio files or videos, pick the desired output format, configure custom output profiles (bitrate, sample rate, channels), and then convert in batches. It supports multithreading, so you can convert many files at the same time without slowing down your workflow. The app also includes tools to preserve metadata (album, artist, track info) and integrate with your music library so converted files are organized and tagged properly.

Beyond converting audio between formats like MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC etc., it can extract audio tracks from video files (MOV, MP4, AVI, MKV and more), turning those into standalone audio files. Output profiles are customizable ‚Äî you can set quality, choose whether to maintain folder structure, manage output location, and more. For those with large collections, it‚Äôs a very efficient way to standardize formats, reduce file sizes, and make audio compatible across devices.

Easy Audio Converter is ideal for musicians, podcasters, DJs, content creators, or anyone who works with multimedia: you can batch your tasks, preserve your tags, and get audio ready for playback, streaming, editing, or archival ‚Äî all in one streamlined tool.
